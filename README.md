I initiated the analysis by combining two datasets, one on calories burned and the other on exercise data, checking for missing values before conducting basic analysis, exploring statistical measures and visualizations. I processed categorical variables, split the data into features and target variables, and trained an XGBoost regressor for model training. Evaluating the model, I calculated the MAE for performance assessment, emphasizing its interpretation within the problem context, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and machine learning concepts.
